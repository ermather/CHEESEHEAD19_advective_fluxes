Things to fix/do later
- Run full lenghth of synthetic data, look at results, deal with any issues that come up
- Look at NSEW v. up/down interpolation
- Run with different interpolation kernels
- Write up Stefan's method
- 


- Move functions into modules (?)
- Consider case when caclculated and measured wind speeds are similar
- Review windspeed calcs - does it all make sense
- Look at raw PFA data - do I have pressure at 30m, if not just use nearest tower at 30 m
- Should I calculate pressure at midway height of tower for density?
- Figure out how to handle towers shorter than 30m
- Figure out true tower heights and how to handle this in calcs









NSEW ->
